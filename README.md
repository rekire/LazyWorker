LazyWorker
==========

LazyWorker a my helper class for doing tasks delayed. Such as checking inputs which require network
operations and should not been done after each key down.

##Setup (gradle based)

Edit your `build.gradle` and add this line to your dependencies:

    compile 'eu.rekisoft.android:lazyworker:1.0.+'

So it should look like this:

    dependencies {
        // other dependencies comes here
        compile 'eu.rekisoft.android:lazyworker:1.0.+'
    }

##Example
A sample implementation will follow soon.
